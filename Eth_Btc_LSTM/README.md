# Stock Prediction LSTM

I've heard that it is impossible (or at least very very difficult) to predict the market, and while I'm not targeting to do so completely, I wanted to know if it was possible to predict the future prices of stocks enough for a bot to make decisions based on it.
(specifically ETH/BTC which maintains a certain dependency as of now)

I took inspiration from:
- [kulbear stock-prediction github](https://github.com/Kulbear/stock-prediction)
- [Deep Convolutional and LSTM Neural Networks for Acoustic Modelling in Automatic Speech Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/804.pdf)
- [Deep Convolutional and LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks for Multimodal Wearable Activity Recognition](http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/16/1/115/html)

Next Steps/Note to self:
- Deep Conv LSTM
- Energy Spectrum Fourier
- Standardize by percentage of previous value
